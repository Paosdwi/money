# Proposed Technology Stack

## Backend
- **Primary Language & Framework**: Python + FastAPI
  - Asynchronous support for high-throughput WebSocket clients and REST APIs.
  - Mature ecosystem for data processing (Pandas, NumPy) and integration with async streaming libraries.
  - FastAPI provides automatic OpenAPI documentation and dependency injection suitable for modular services.
- **Alternative Considerations**: Node.js + NestJS for teams favoring TypeScript and a structured MVC pattern; Go microservices for latency-critical ingestion workers.

## Data Processing & Messaging
- **Streaming Platform**: Apache Kafka or Redpanda for durable event streaming, supporting topic partitioning and consumer groups for scalability.
- **Stream Processing**: Apache Flink or Kafka Streams for stateful processing; alternatively, Python-based Faust for lighter workloads.
- **Task Orchestration**: Prefect or Apache Airflow for scheduled batch jobs (backfills, reconciliation).

## Storage
- **Time-series Storage**: TimescaleDB (PostgreSQL extension) to leverage SQL semantics and hypertables for ticks/candles.
- **Analytical Warehouse**: ClickHouse for columnar analytics and cost-effective retention of historical depth snapshots.
- **Cache & State Store**: Redis for low-latency access, with Redis Streams for transient alert state.

## Frontend & Visualization
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript for component reusability and type safety.
- **UI Toolkit**: Ant Design or Material UI for rapid dashboard composition.
- **Real-time Updates**: Use WebSocket clients (Socket.IO or native WebSocket) combined with React Query for caching and synchronization.

## Alerting & Notifications
- **Rule Engine**: Use a dedicated service with Redis/Timescale lookups; consider OpenFGA or custom policy evaluation for complex conditions.
- **Notification Channels**: Integrate with Slack, email (SES), and PagerDuty via dedicated microservice.

## Infrastructure & DevOps
- **Containerization**: Docker images orchestrated by Kubernetes (EKS/GKE) with Horizontal Pod Autoscaler.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform for reproducible environments.
- **Observability**: Prometheus + Grafana for metrics, Loki for logs, OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing.
